##Things I learned making this
- First time using the context API outside of a lesson; used for dark mode with localstorage
- named importing of images
- making a ...module.css style sheet
- root variables in css
- nested CSS, never say that before or even heard of it
- importing all google fonts at once, i think i forgot about that
