# React single page portfolio

##Things I learned making this
- First time using the context API outside of a lesson; used for dark mode with localstorage
- named importing of images
- making a ...module.css style sheet
- root variables in css
- nested CSS, never saw that before or even heard of it, not working for me
- importing all google fonts at once, i think i forgot about that
- 100dvh instead of vh; section takes up entire device screen 
- using svgs
